                Pre-authorization services require expertise and skills beyond
                normal and are the most sought-after solution. To reduce
                denials, it’s one step that provides exceptional benefits in the
                short and long terms. By using pre-authorization services, you
                can make a big change in your revenue cycle management and
                ensure maximum submissions. Outsourcing this function of your
                healthcare facility ends administrative burden and promotes
                error-free work. It’s important to understand that
                pre-authorization is necessary for many inpatient and outpatient
                services; failure to do so results in rejection. Even if the
                patient has full insurance coverage, a small error can make it
                difficult to get reimbursements on time. Without
                pre-certifications, a provider may lose money on the services
                provided to the patient.
